# bestviewpoint

This project contains the software to automatically find the best point of view of a 3D object by analyzing its 2D projection.

The 3D objects must be stored in the <code>objs</code> subdirectory. The files must be in the standard .obj format initially defined by Wavefront. 

You can download some .obj files of this type, and demonstrative videos that show the execution of this automatic optimization from here:
